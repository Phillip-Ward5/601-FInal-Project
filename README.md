Utilized the Wine dataset and performed data preprocessing by cleaning up the data and handling missing values.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables using plots and statistical summaries to uncover underlying patterns and insights.
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality, facilitating better visualization and understanding of the data structure.
Built predictive modeling through histograms, built least squares regression, performed PCA analysis, and identified outlier data in the Wine dataset using various modules such as scipy.stats, sklearn, numpy, and pandas.
